This file contains a few notes about the DarcNES Multi-System emulator.

DarcNES is Copyright 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 by Alastair Bridgewater.

Commercial use prohibited without express written permission from
the author. Everyone else can do whatever they want, provided that
I am credited in the documentation (and, if released, the source code).

People wishing to maintain a port for another system should contact me
beforehand in order to learn the ground rules (and to make sure that no
one else is already maintaining a port for that system).


Disclaimer:

This software is provided AS IS, etc. No warranty, etc, etc. You know
the drill.


Usage notes:

    DOS users: edit the Makefile, the required changes should be fairly
obvious. keys are 'A', 'S', '[', ']', arrows, and escape.

    Linux/BSD users (both SVGALib and XWindows): If you are on an a.out
system (as opposed to an ELF system), you may need to add "-DASM_UNDERBARS"
to SFLAGS in the Makefile.

    SVGALib users: edit the Makefile, the required change should be
fairly obvious. keys are the same as the dos version + ctrl, alt, tab, and
enter.

    XWindows users: keys are the same as the dos version. you have to use
file->exit to save the battery file (if any). if you don't specify a file
on the command line, "cart.nes" will be used.

    All other users: Good luck. Keys tend to be the same as for the DOS
version, and the interface is usually fairly obvious.


CD support notes:

    To use the CD support, just load one of the syscard images as a ROM.
Having a game CD in the drive at the time helps.

    DOS users: No such luck. I believe CD support to be disabled for allegro
builds.

    Linux/BSD users: CD support should build automatically and correctly. The
only thing you might want to check is the definition of CDROM_DEVICE in the
appropriate section of cd_unix.c.

    People who want to use ISO/FCD/HCD files: Go away. I have less than no
interest in adding support for file formats used primarily for piracy when it
is still possible to acquire legit CDs which will work in all modern computers.


BIOS files:

    ColecoVision emulation requires a file called "coleco.rom".
    FDS emulation requires a file called "disksys.rom".
    MSX emulation requires a file called "msx.rom".
    Apple ][ emulation requires the following: "applecg.bin", "disk_ii.rom",
"fpbasic_d0.rom", "fpbasic_d8.rom", "fpbasic_e0.rom", "fpbasic_e8.rom",
"fpbasic_f0.rom", and "autostart_f8.rom".

    With a recompile, the Apple ][ emulator can be convinced to use the integer
basic ROM set ("programmers_aide_d0.rom", "intbasic_e0.rom", "intbasic_e8.rom",
and "intbasic_f0.rom") instead of the "fpbasic_*.rom" set used for Applesoft
BASIC. You can also substitute "monitor_f8.rom" for the autostart ROM, but I
have been unable to find an uncorrupt copy of the monitor ROM.

    All this should eventually be user-configurable.


How to compile for non-x86 systems:

    In the Makefile, uncomment the line about "C_ONLY" and select the
BYTE_ORDER to be appropriate for your CPU. Also comment out the definition of
MACH_TYPES (or write your own types_whatever.h, and set MACH_TYPES to it).
    If you are using a compiler other than gcc, you will likely need to edit
types.h to work with your compiler.
    Build as per normal.


Things that need work:

    CAL. (has to be gotten rid of)
    GUI. (Linux/XWin one is junk, DOS one doesn't exist)
    Video. (XWin needs to support SHM/DGA, DOS needs to support 16bpp, all
need to support 24bpp)
    Documentation. (If you haven't noticed by now, I don't like writing
it. I also don't comment my code very much either, prefering to spend
my time making it obvious enough to not need comments)
