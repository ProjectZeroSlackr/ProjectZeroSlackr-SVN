Overview:
Floydzilla
- Floydzilla (latest version called "Floyd2illA") is
  a customized build of podzilla legacy (PZ0).
- It contains numerous (unstable) games and applications
  that were not part of the official podzilla legacy
  but can mostly now be found as podzilla2 modules.
- DansFloyd (the creator) stopped working on Floydzilla
  a while after the introduction of podzilla2 but before
  that, Floydzilla was arguably the most popular and
  widely used zilla, notable for its added games and
  support for iBoy.
- Since it is based off podzilla legacy, Floydzilla
  will not run smoothly on iPod videos (5G/5.5Gs),
  which were introduced after PZ0 was abandoned.
- The ZeroSlackr version is built with MPD support but
  MPD itself must be initiated externally first (see the
  MPD documentation).
