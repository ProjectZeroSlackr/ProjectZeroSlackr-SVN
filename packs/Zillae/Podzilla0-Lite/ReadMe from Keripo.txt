Overview:
Podzilla0-Lite
- Podzilla0-Lite is a slimmed down, customized build of
  podzilla legacy (PZ0).
- It is drastically reduced in size and functionality
  (almost all games and applications removed) but has
  PodWrite added (code referenced from Floydzilla)
- Podzilla0-Lite is intended on a lightweight, backup
  zilla to be executed by the ZeroSlackr userland in
  the case ZeroLauncher fails (a hex edited version
  is included in the ZeroSlackr userland) and was never
  released as a separate application.

Usage:
- FastLaunch through "Zillae > Podzilla0-Lite".
